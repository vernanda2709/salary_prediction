# salary_prediction
Salary prediction is a machine learning project to predict a person's salary based on length of work experience using regression, decision tree, and random forest methods.

# Supervised Salary Prediction
Supervised Salary Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict a person's salary based on years of experience. In this project, several supervised learning algorithms are used to compare the performance of prediction models, namely:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet effective approach for linear relationships.
- **Decision Tree**: A flexible tree structure based approach.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble approach that improves accuracy through a combination of decision trees.

This project provides insight into how various machine learning algorithms can be applied to numerical prediction problems.

## üìä Dataset
I'm using The dataset from this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F0eScJlePaZkQJxBNCJHhU6p3pE7LHFO/view 
 which contains two main columns:
1. **YearsExperience**: The number of years of a person's work experience (in years).
2. **Salary**: An individual's salary (in a specific currency unit).

This dataset is very simple yet ideal for exploring supervised learning algorithms. The data will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model


## üîç Methods and Algorithms
This project uses three main algorithms:
1. **Linear Regression**: 
   - Finds the linear relationship between years of work experience and salary.
   - Suitable for simple linear relationships.
2. **Decision Tree**: 
   - Builds a decision tree-based model to capture non-linear relationships.
   - Allows flexible data division based on certain thresholds.
3. **Random Forest**:
   - Ensemble learning that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
   - Reduces overfitting that often occurs with a single decision tree.

Each algorithm will be tested and compared using evaluation metrics such as:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (R¬≤)**

## üöÄ Output and Analysis
The deliverables produced from this project include:
1. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Graph of the initial distribution of data (salary vs. work experience).
   - Graph of predictions generated by each model.
2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Comparison of model performance based on MSE and R¬≤.
   - Analysis of the weaknesses and advantages of each algorithm.
3. **Salary Prediction**:
   - Ability to predict salary based on new work experience provided by the user.
